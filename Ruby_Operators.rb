# Math operators
a = 15
b = 30
 puts a + b
 puts a * b
 
 # divides left by right
 puts b / a

 #modulus - division but outputs remainder
 puts b % a

 #exponent - power
 puts 2**2

 #Comparison Operators

 # = is setting a value
 # == is equals

 puts a == b # should output false
 # != checks if not equals
 puts a != b # should output true
 # <, > basic comparison. you can do >= <= to check if greater/less than or equal
 puts a < b
 puts a > b

 #combined comparison. returns 0 if equals, 1 if a > b, -1 if a < b
 puts a <=> b # should output -1

 # can also used to compare other stuff
# can be also used to assign variables like:
var = a * b

puts var # should output 450
